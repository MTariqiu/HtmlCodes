----------------------Why Semantic Elements?--------------------
With HTML4, developers used their own id/class names to style elements: header, top, bottom, footer, menu, navigation, main, container, content, article, sidebar, topnav, etc.

This made it impossible for search engines to identify the correct web page content.

With the new HTML5 elements (<header> <footer> <nav> <section> <article>), this will become easier.

According to the W3C, a Semantic Web: "Allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and communities."
