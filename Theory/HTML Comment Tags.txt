--------------HTML Comment Tags---------------------

You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
<!-- Write your comments here -->

Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the opening tag, but not in the closing tag.

Note: Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML:
Example
<!-- This is a comment -->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- Remember to add more information here -->

Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors:
Example
<!-- Do not display this at the moment
<img border="0" src="pic_mountain.jpg" alt="Mountain">
-->
